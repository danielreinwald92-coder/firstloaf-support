  First Loaf ("we", "our", or "the app") respects your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.

  ## Data We Collect

  ### Data You Provide
  - **Recipes and bakes:** Ingredients, steps, timing, and notes you enter
  - **Photos:** Images you attach to bakes (stored locally and optionally synced)
  - **Starter logs:** Feeding schedules and observations
  - **Account info:** If you sign in with Apple, we receive your Apple ID and optionally your name/email

  ### Data Collected Automatically
  - **None.** We do not use analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs.

  ## How Your Data Is Stored

  ### Local Storage
  All your data is stored locally on your device first. The app works fully offline.

  ### Cloud Sync (Optional)
  If you sign in with Apple, your data syncs to our secure servers (powered by Supabase) so you can access it across devices. You can delete your account and all cloud data at any time in Settings.

  ## How We Use Your Data

  We use your data solely to:
  - Provide the app's features (recipes, bake tracking, timers)
  - Sync across your devices (if signed in)
  - Process purchases (via Apple's App Store)

  We do **not**:
  - Sell your data
  - Share your data with third parties
  - Use your data for advertising
  - Track your behavior

  ## Third-Party Services

  - **Apple Sign In:** Authentication is handled by Apple. See [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/).
  - **Apple App Store:** Purchases are processed by Apple. We do not see your payment information.
  - **Supabase:** Cloud data is stored on Supabase servers. See [Supabase Privacy Policy](https://supabase.com/privacy).

  ## Data Retention

  - **Local data:** Remains on your device until you delete the app or clear data
  - **Cloud data:** Retained until you delete your account

  ## Your Rights

  You can:
  - **Export your data:** Settings → Export Data
  - **Delete your account:** Settings → Delete Account (removes all cloud data)
  - **Use offline only:** Simply don't sign in—all features work locally

  ## Children's Privacy

  First Loaf is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

  ## Changes to This Policy

  We may update this policy occasionally. We'll note the date at the top when we do.
